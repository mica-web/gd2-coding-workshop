# HTML vs CSS

HTML and CSS are partners in delivering what you've experienced as the web. Each has a specific role to play in making a web page:

- **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) adds meaning and structure to your web page's content.
- **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) formats that content and modifies the layout.

You can ðŸ’¯ have an HTML page without CSS, but a stylesheet without an HTML document is meaningless. 

Both HTML and CSS use some familiar English words -- `main`, `aside`, `color`, `border` -- but it's important to use the precise words; while `color` is a valid CSS property, `colors` is not -- the addition of that single letter will result in broken code. ðŸ‘Ž

HTML is a declarative language -- it doesn't allow for dynamic content (for example, if the user is logged in, show them account info, if they're not logged in, show them a log in form); that sort of logic requires use of a programming language along with HTML (which is above and beyond what we'll cover in this workshop).

CSS has a bit more flexibility because it handles interactions (for example, when a user hovers on a link, it changes color) and layout changes based on device size, but it's still not as robust as a programming language.
