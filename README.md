## Why Learn to Code

If you want to be a front-end or UI developer, learning to code is a necessity.

Those, however, aren't the only careers that benefit from learning some basics of coding. As a designer, knowing some basics means:

- **You're a better designer.** If you're working on web projects or apps, some experience coding will mean that you understand the limitations and possibilities of the web better.

- **You're a better collaborator.** If you're working with developers to execute a project you've designed, some experience coding will allow you to speak their language a bit more. You'll be better able to communicate your expectations, especially around responsive designs.

- **You're a more valuabe employee** because you have a broad set of skills and have proven you can learn new ones!

Finally, if you've never coded before, you don't know whether you enjoy it. It's great to get an introduction and learn more about what's possible!
