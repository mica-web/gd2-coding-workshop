Request help with your project:
Struggling to solve something in your project? If it’s outside of class hours, use this web form:  https://forms.gle/9Lpq2vqLrnYzY5mv7 and I’ll review and reply via email 👍
Even if we’ve emailed about a previous problem, please use this form to report any new issues. My MICA email box is kind of a mess, and I’ve added a filter to prioritize the emails that come in via this form -- so, long story short, using the form is the best way to get my attention. 😁
